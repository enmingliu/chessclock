# Why

```
HOW ABOUT A NICE GAME OF CHESS?
```

Not Global Thermonuclear War?

```
NOT THIS TIME.
```

Okay.

```
YOU LIKE PLAYING CHESS.
```

This is good.

```
YOUR FRIENDS LIKE PLAYING CHESS.
```

This is also good.

```
YOU (OR YOUR FRIENDS) TAKE TOO LONG TO MAKE YOUR (OR THEIR) MOVES.
```

This is not good.

Games take forever, you (or your friends) hate the implicit rudeness, and no
one wants to play with you (or them).

It is hard to break the habit of analyzing every possible move, though.

```
YOU NEED A CHESS CLOCK.
```

A chess clock gives you a time limit in which to make all of your moves.

At the start of each turn, you press a button to resume your clock's countdown
from that limit. If your clock runs out of time, you lose.

```
THAT WILL FIX IT.
```

Actual chess clocks are expensive, large, and inconvenient to take with you, however.

Is there an alternative to an actual chess clock?

```
YOU HAVE A MAGICAL POCKET COMPUTER.
```

Magical pocket computers can be made to do many things by installing apps.

```
YOU NEED A CHESS CLOCK APP.
```

You could buy an app for your magical pocket computer that turns it into a chess clock.

```
IT IS FUN TO MAKE THINGS, THOUGH.
```

Especially things for your magical pocket computer.

```
IT IS TIME TO MAKE A CHESS CLOCK APP FOR YOURSELF.
```

That sounds like more fun than Global Thermonuclear War.
